# Customer Segmentation of Mobile Users â€“ Data Science Project
This project aims to segment mobile users based on their usage patterns, device characteristics, and demographic information using KMeans clustering. The project covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, clustering, and several ad-hoc analyses, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for visualization and cluster centroid analysis. The insights derived from this project can help businesses make data-driven decisions for personalized services, product development, or targeted marketing strategies.

# Project Overview
##### -> Goal: Segment mobile users into distinct groups (clusters) based on their behavior and characteristics.
##### -> Methodology: Data preprocessing and feature scaling.
##### -> Applying KMeans clustering to create segments.
##### -> Visualizing clusters using PCA and analyzing key patterns in the data.
##### ->  Performing ad-hoc analyses such as summary statistics, boxplots, correlation analysis, and optimal cluster determination using the elbow method.
